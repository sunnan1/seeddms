Swagger
========

Swagger is used to describe a rest api. SeedDMS ships a swagger.yaml file
in the restapi directory. You can load this file into a swagger editor, e.g.
http://petstore.swagger.io/ or http://editor.swagger.io/

Your apache needs to have the module 'header' enabled, because some HTTP headers
are set when the file swagger.yaml is accessed by the editor.
